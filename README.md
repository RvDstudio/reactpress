# WORDPRESS + REACT = REACTPRESS = ðŸ’›

Start a SEO-friendly Decoupled Wordpress with React in minutes.

## Gettings started

```sh
npm install
# start the dev server.
npm run dev
```

You're ready to go ! You can now start working by looking / hacking / editing **pages** and **components** and **css** directories ! <br /><br />

By default, reactpress uses a demo API, so code is working out of the box. To connect your own API, edit **reactpress.config.js** file and set
**REACTPRESS_WORDPRESS_API_URL** so that is points to your **REST API V2** Wordpress api endpoint.

```js
export default {
  REACTPRESS_WORDPRESS_API_URL:
    "https://public-api.wordpress.com/wp/v2/sites/reactpressapi.wordpress.com"
};
```

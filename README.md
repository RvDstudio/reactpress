Under the hood, Reactpress is using the awesome [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/). 

## Gettings started

### 1 - Make sure CORS are enabled on your Wordpress

Reactpress is only the **front-end** for your application. It's up to you to install Wordpress as you would usually do. Please note that REST Api v2 is automatically enabled since Wordpress 4.7. CORS are special headers to make sure server allows us to pull data from its API. You can add this to your wp-config.php to make sure CORS are enabled.

```php
// allow CORS
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
```

### 2 - Install Reactpress

```sh
# install dependencis
npm install
# start the dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev
```

### 3 - Add your wordpress api to reactpress.config.js


By default, reactpress uses a demo API. To connect your own API, edit **reactpress.config.js** file and edit variable **wordpressApiUrl** so that it points to your wordpress API. Don't forget the **wp-json** at the end of the url.

```js
module.exports = {
  wordpressApiUrl: "https://dev-reactpress.pantheonsite.io/wp-json"
};
```

You can now start hacking / editing **pages** and **components** directories !

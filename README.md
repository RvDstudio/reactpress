# WORDPRESS + REACT = REACTPRESS ðŸ’›

Start a SEO-friendly Decoupled Wordpress with React in minutes.

## Gettings started

### make sur CORS is enabled on Wordpress

add this to your wp-config.php to make sure CORS are enabled :

```php
// allow CORS
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
```

### install

```sh
npm install
# start the dev server.
npm run dev
```

You're ready to go ! You can now start working by looking / hacking / editing **pages** and **components** and **css** directories ! <br /><br />

By default, reactpress uses a demo API, so code is working out of the box.<br /> To connect your own API, edit **reactpress.config.js** file and edit variable
**wordpressUrl** so that is points to your wordpress site with **REST API V2** and CORS enabled :

```js
export default {
  wordpressUrl: "https://dev-reactpress.pantheonsite.io"
};
```
